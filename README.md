 The pitch: 718 permutations of the word "RICARD" colored in such a way as to make the famous portrait by Lange appear.

 The (two) identity permutations "RICARD" are replaced by "······" 

 However, since the permutations are sorted randomly, the word "RICARD" can appear through the collision of two other permutations: e.g. DARRIC + ARDRIC.

 People who really have nothing else to do can have fun trying to find the lucky collisions. 

Already tedious in itself, this thankless task is made even more difficult by 3 obstacles:

1. if the length/width ratio of the screen is not that of the original table, some parts of the table are not even visible,

2. many letters are hardly legible, and

3. it is not granted that a collision be present

## Tips and tricks

* Press 'Enter' starts a slideshow
* Press 'Escape' stops it
* Typing 'cheat' reveals the happy collisions
* Pressing 'Spacebar' or clicking anywhare reorders the permutations
