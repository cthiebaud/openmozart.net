## The pitch

718 permutations of the word "RICARD" colored in such a way as to make a bottle appear.

Permutations are randomly sorted; the order changes with each refresh of the page.

The (2) identity permutations "RICARD" are replaced by "∅∅∅∅∅∅" 

However, since permutations are sorted randomly, the word "RICARD" can appear through the collision of two other permutations: e.g. "DAR·RIC" then "ARD·RIC".

Furthermore, "RICARD" may appear vertically.

People who really have nothing else to do can have fun trying to find the lucky collisions and the vertical coincidences.

Already tedious in itself, this unglamorous task is made even more difficult by 3 obstacles:

1. if the length/width ratio of the screen is not that of the original image, some parts are not even visible,

2. many letters are hardly legible, and

3. there is no guarantee that a collision or a vertical coincidence exists in the current page.

## Tips and tricks

* Clicking anywhere sets a new random order for the permutations
* Pressing 'Enter' starts a slideshow that reorders every 2 seconds
* Pressing 'Spacebar' stops the slideshow if any, otherwise, it reorders
* Typing 'cheat' reveals the happy collision(s) and the undreamed-of vertical coincidence(s)
* Pressing 'Escape' stops cheating

### Mobile gestures

* Tap: sets a new random order for the permutations
* Horizontal swipe: toggles slideshow
* Long press (also known as 'press and hold'): toggles cheating
