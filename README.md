## The pitch

718 permutations of the word "RICARD" colored in such a way as to make a bottle appear.

The (2) identity permutations "RICARD" are replaced by "······" 

However, since the permutations are sorted randomly, the word "RICARD" can appear through the collision of two other permutations: e.g. DARRIC + ARDRIC.

Furthermore, it may appear vertically.

People who really have nothing else to do can have fun trying to find the lucky collisions and the vertical coincidence.

Already tedious in itself, this unglamorous task is made even more difficult by 3 obstacles:

1. if the length/width ratio of the screen is not that of the original image, some parts are not even visible,

2. many letters are hardly legible, and

3. there is no guarantee that a collision or a vertical alignment exists in the current page.

## Tips and tricks

* Pressing 'Escape' stops it
* Typing 'cheat' reveals the happy collisions
* Pressing 'Escape' stops cheating
* Pressing 'Spacebar' or clicking anywhere reorders
