## The Pitch

718 permutations of the word "RICARD" colored in such a way as to make a bottle appear.

Permutations are randomly sorted; the order changes with each refresh of the page.

According to [Factorial Calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/discretemathematics/factorials.php), there are \~= ``2.6 E+1746`` (``!720``) 
possible orderings of (``719 + 1``) permutations. That's a lot. Much, much more than the atoms in the observable universe (\~[``1.0 E83``](https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/))

The (2) identity permutations "RICARD" are replaced by "∅∅∅∅∅∅" 

However, since permutations are sorted randomly, the word "RICARD" can appear through the collision of two other permutations: e.g. "DAR·RIC" then "ARD·RIC".

Furthermore, "RICARD" may appear vertically.

People who really have nothing else to do can have fun trying to find the lucky collisions and the vertical coincidences.

Already tedious in itself, this unglamorous task is made even more difficult by three obstacles:

1. if the length/width ratio of the screen is not that of the original image, some parts are not even visible,

2. many letters are hardly legible, and

3. there is no guarantee that a collision or a vertical alignment exists in the current sort.

## Tips and Tricks

### On a Browser

* Clicking anywhere sets a new random order for the permutations.
* Pressing 'Enter' starts a slideshow that reorders every 2 seconds.
* Pressing 'Spacebar' stops the slideshow when it is running; otherwise, it sets a new random order.
* Typing 'cheat' reveals the happy collision(s) and the undreamed-of vertical coincidence(s), if any.
* Pressing 'Escape' stops cheating.

### On a Mobile Phone

* Tap: sets a new random order for the permutations.
* Horizontal swipe: toggles slideshow.
* Long press (also known as 'press and hold'): toggles cheating.
