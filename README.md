## The pitch

719 permutations of the name "MOZART" colored in such a way as to make a bottle appear.

The identity permutations "MOZART" is replaced by "●●●●●●·" 

However, since the permutations are sorted randomly, the name "MOZART" can appear through the collision of two other permutations: e.g. "TAR·MOZ" then "ART·ZOM".

Furthermore, "MOZART" may appear vertically.

People who really have nothing else to do may have fun trying to find the happy collisions and the vertical coincidences.

Already tedious in itself, this unglamorous task is made even more difficult by 3 obstacles:

1. if the length/width ratio of the screen is not that of the original image, some parts are not even visible,

2. a large number of almost black letters on a dark brown background are illegible, and

3. there is no guarantee that a collision or a vertical alignment exists in the current page.

## Tips and tricks

* Pressing 'Enter' starts a slideshow
* Pressing 'Escape' stops it
* Typing 'cheat' reveals the happy collisions and the undreamed of vertical coincidences
* Pressing 'Escape' stops cheating
* Pressing 'Spacebar' or clicking anywhere refresh the screen, and thus the ordering of the permutations
