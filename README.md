## The pitch

718 permutations of the word "RICARD" colored in such a way as to make a bottle appear.

The (2) identity permutations "RICARD" are replaced by "∅∅∅∅∅∅" 

However, since permutations are sorted randomly, the word "RICARD" can appear through the collision of two other permutations: e.g. "DAR·RIC" then "ARD·RIC".

Furthermore, "RICARD" may appear vertically.

People who really have nothing else to do can have fun trying to find the lucky collisions and the vertical coincidences.

Already tedious in itself, this unglamorous task is made even more difficult by 3 obstacles:

1. if the length/width ratio of the screen is not that of the original image, some parts are not even visible,

2. many letters are hardly legible, and

3. there is no guarantee that a collision or a vertical coincidence exists in the current page.

## Tips and tricks

* Pressing 'Enter' starts a slideshow
* Pressing 'Escape' stops it
* Typing 'cheat' reveals the lucky collisions and the undreamed-of vertical coincidences
* Pressing 'Escape' stops cheating
* Pressing 'Spacebar' or clicking anywhere refreshes the screen, thus the ordering of the permutations

### Mobile gestures

* Swipe to right: toggles slideshow
* Tap: refreshes the screen
* Press: toggles cheating
